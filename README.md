# Trivia Game

## Description
Trivia Game is an app that tests users with fun trivia questions across different topics and difficulty levels. Users can customize their game by choosing the number of questions, category, and question type (Multiple Choice or True/False). After answering, the app shows a score, and users can see which answers were correct. It includes a timer to put users under pressure.

## Features
### Required Features
- App launches to an Options screen where users can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts:
  - Number of questions
  - Category of questions
  - Difficulty of questions
  - Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True/False)
- Users can tap a button to start the trivia game, presenting questions and answers in a List or Card view.
- Selected choices are marked as users tap their choice (but answers are not presented yet).
- Users can submit choices and are presented with a score.

### Optional Features
- Users have answers marked as correct or incorrect after submitting choices (alongside their score).
- Implemented a timer that puts pressure on the user, auto-submitting choices after the timer expires.

### Additional Features
- Created an App Icon with the name of the App.
- Created a LaunchScreen using SwiftUI.

## Notes
I had trouble with the LaunchScreen. Initially, I made a storyboard along with the LaunchScreen, but the simulator wasn't showing it. I created a LaunchScreen file using SwiftUI, and it works great.
